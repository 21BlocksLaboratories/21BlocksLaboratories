If you land on the 'blockstream' block you will be entering the Liquid Network. (There will be a card explaining the process of pegging-in the Liquid Network.)
The miner will again roll again during this turn. While on the Liquid Network, the miner will roll only one dice. After each miner rolls, any miner located on either 
Layer 2 (Liquid/Lightning) will roll another single dice that they will add to their initial roll for their new total for that roll. This is so miners located on either
Layer 2 are not at a disadvantage of winning the block reward (The roll total that landed the miner on the 'blockstream' block will be voided. Only the single 
dice roll on Liquid and the additional single dice roll after each miner completed their roll will be counted during this process.)


Blocks located on the Liquid Network, all have predetermind action.

THIS SPACE WILL BE UPDATED AS WE FISNISH UP THE DESIGN
