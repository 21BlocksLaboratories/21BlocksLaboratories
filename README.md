Hello Everyone,

We are 21 Blocks Laboratories and we are building out the first Bitcoin ONLY board game. This is the first of several projects we plan on realeasing. 
With this project specifically, we wanted to open source the the rules ogf the game. We also plan on open sourcing the name of the game. Striving to engage with the community was a major goal we seeked out from the beginning. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel to send me a message or message me on Twitter @21BlocksLab. 

The basis for the rules are listed under the respective sections. The goal of this will be to get a final version of rules based on consensus from the community. 
Please suggest some changes, make tweaks, give advice, give us crap or just drop a word. Any and all help will be much appreciated. 

WE WILL NOT BE RELEASING ANY GAME DESIGN AS THIS IS OUR IP. WE WILL RELEASE SOME UPDATED PRODUCT/CONTENT ITEMS DURING THE PROCESS. 
WE WILL BE OFFERING BOUNTIES FOR SPECIFIC ISSUES WE FIND DURING THE COURSE OF OUR BUILD. AWARDS WILL BE SENT VIA LIGHTNING. BE SURE TO CHECK OUT THE 
BOUNTY FILE FOR UPDATED STATUS ON CURRENT BOUNTIES.
