When you are sent to the ‘Memepool’, you must move directly into the Memepool space. Your turn ends when you are sent to the Memepool.

To be released from the Mempool, can happen in two ways only. 
Option 1:
If you choose to deploy the "Get Out of Mempool" card, which again ends your turn and makes you non-eligible of being awarded a block reward. Return the card to 
the bottom of the deck after it being used. 
Option 2:
Would be to pay your way out of the Mempool at cost to be determined (Looking for isnight or alternative route to be removed from the Memepool). 
Possibly choose to “Burn” some UTXO’s at a value of your last halving reward to get out of the Memepool. If you choose this option, your turn is forfeited & you 
can roll on your next turn. Taking this route, you still forfeit your oppurtunity on receiveing a block reward.
