During the gameplay, if you land on the Mempool block, you are considered as passing by. Your miner shall stay outside of the Mempool area and your miner shall 
remain in thge white are of the block. 

Landing on 'Failed Transaction' block, you will be sent automatically to the Mempool. You will forfeit your turn and be non-eligible of receiving the block reward. 

When you are sent to the ‘Memepool’ by the Feature or Bug card, you must move directly into the Memepool space. You will forfeit your turn and be non-eligible of 
receiving the block reward.

To be released from the Mempool, this can happen in two ways only. 

Option 1:
If you choose to deploy the "Get Out of Mempool" card, which again ends your turn and makes you non-eligible of being awarded a block reward. Return the card to 
the bottom of the deck after it being used. Move your miner into the white area where it says 'TICK TOCK NEXT BLOCK'. 

Option 2:
Would be to pay your way out of the Mempool at cost to be determined (Looking for isnight or alternative route to be removed from the Memepool). 
Possibly choose to “Burn” some UTXO’s at a value of your last halving reward to get out of the Memepool. If you choose this option, your turn is forfeited & you 
can roll on your next turn. Taking this route, you still forfeit your oppurtunity on receiveing a block reward.
